# Agent Cowork

A **desktop AI assistant** that helps you with **programming, file management, and any task you can describe**.

It is **fully compatible with the exact same configuration as Claude Code**, which means you can run it with **any Anthropic-compatible large language model**.

> Not just a GUI.  
> A real AI collaboration partner.  
> No need to learn the Claude Agent SDK — just create tasks and choose execution paths.

## ✨ Why Agent Cowork?

Claude Code is powerful — but it **only runs in the terminal**.

That means:
- ❌ No visual feedback for complex tasks
- ❌ Hard to track multiple sessions
- ❌ Tool outputs are inconvenient to inspect

**Agent Cowork solves these problems:**

- 🖥️ Runs as a **native desktop application**
- 🤖 Acts as your **AI collaboration partner** for any task
- 🔁 Reuses your **existing `~/.claude/settings.json`**
- 🧠 **100% compatible** with Claude Code

If Claude Code works on your machine —  
**Agent Cowork works too.**
